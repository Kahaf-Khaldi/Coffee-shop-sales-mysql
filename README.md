# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis – SQL Project

---

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing coffee shop sales data using **MySQL**. The dataset includes details such as transaction dates, times, product categories, quantities, prices, and store locations.

**Objectives:**

- Clean and prepare raw sales data.  
- Build KPI dashboards for Total Sales, Orders, and Quantity.  
- Analyze sales trends across time, store locations, and product categories.  
- Derive insights into customer behavior and business performance.  

---

## Key Insights

- Total Sales, Orders, and Quantity calculated for different periods (daily, monthly).  
- Month-on-Month (MoM) growth for key metrics to track performance trends.  
- Sales distribution across weekdays vs weekends to identify demand patterns.  
- Daily sales compared with average sales to classify days as **Above Average** or **Below Average**.  
- Sales by store location to evaluate top-performing outlets.  
- Sales by product category and top 10 products to highlight best sellers.  
- Sales trend by hour of day to capture peak customer activity.

## Business Value

- Helps management understand **when and where sales peak**.  
- Identifies high-performing stores and products to optimize inventory.  
- Highlights **customer behavior patterns** (weekday vs weekend, peak hours).  
- Provides actionable KPIs for **monitoring business growth** over time.

## Tools & Skills

- **MySQL** → Data cleaning, aggregation, window functions, trend analysis  
- **SQL Analytics** → KPIs, performance metrics, business insights  
- **Data Wrangling** → Date/time formatting, schema corrections, query optimization

## How to Use

1. Import the dataset into MySQL (table: `coffee_shop_sales`).  
2. Run the queries provided in this repository.  
3. Explore results for different months, categories, or store locations by modifying filters.

## Key Learnings

- How to use **window functions** (`LAG()`, `AVG() OVER`) for growth and trend analysis.  
- Using **CASE statements** for conditional grouping (Weekday vs Weekend, Above/Below Average).  
- Designing **KPIs** for business reporting and performance monitoring.  
- Translating raw sales data into actionable **business insights**.
